My name is **Roman Filimonov** and I student of Minsk College of Business as a programmer.
I want to become a good programmer 'cause I really intrested in this theme.

## Interest

Of course I intrested in programming, but at my free time as all student , I think, I like to play some video games or surfing interI Also, like to read books and listen to lectures about philosophy and psychology, 'cause I think it can help me in my daily life.

## Knowledge

I have some experience in programming because in studying at college.
I know Delphi at good level, 'cause it was my first language(except Pascal ABC) at my life. 
I make my coursework at this language. Also, I know PHP, HTML and CSS(how to work with Bootstrap 4, make your own styles without Bootstap ). I make site for internet market(not real, of course) as my project at college.
